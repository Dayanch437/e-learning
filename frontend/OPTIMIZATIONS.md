# Frontend Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented for the frontend application.

## API Caching System

The API caching system improves frontend performance by:

1. Reducing redundant API calls
2. Decreasing load times for frequently accessed data
3. Reducing server load
4. Improving offline experience
5. Reducing bandwidth usage

### Implementation Details

- **ApiCache Class**: Implements a memory-based cache with configurable TTL (Time-To-Live)
- **Cached API Service**: Wrapper around Axios that automatically handles caching for GET requests
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatically invalidates related cache entries when POST/PUT/DELETE operations are performed
- **Cache Prefetching**: Utility for preloading data that users are likely to need

### Usage Examples

#### Basic API Usage

```typescript
// Before optimization
const data = await api.get('/center/categories/');

// After optimization with automatic caching
const data = await cachedApi.get('/center/categories/');
```

#### React Hook

```typescript
// Using the custom hook for cached API calls
const { data, loading, error, refetch } = useCachedFetch(
  () => categoryAPI.getAll(),
  []
);
```

#### Prefetching Data

```typescript
// Prefetch dashboard data when user logs in
DataPrefetcher.prefetchDashboard();

// Prefetch vocabulary practice data when user navigates to practice page
DataPrefetcher.prefetchVocabularyPractice('beginner');
```

## Code Splitting

We've implemented code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense to:

1. Reduce initial bundle size
2. Improve application startup time
3. Load components on-demand

## Responsive Design Optimizations

1. **Throttled resize events**: Prevent excessive re-renders on window resize
2. **Optimized layout components**: Use proper breakpoints and responsive design patterns
3. **Mobile-first approach**: Ensure good performance on mobile devices

## Future Optimizations

1. Service Worker for offline support and caching
2. Component-level memoization to reduce unnecessary renders
3. Image optimization strategies
4. Bundle analysis and optimization

## Best Practices

1. Always use the cached API service for read operations
2. Be mindful of cache TTL values based on how frequently data changes
3. Use code splitting for large components
4. Implement throttling for frequently triggered events
