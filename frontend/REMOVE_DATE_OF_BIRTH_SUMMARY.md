# âœ… Date of Birth Removed from Registration

## Changes Made

### 1. âœ… Register Component (`/src/components/Auth/Register.tsx`)
- **Removed** `date_of_birth?: string;` from `RegisterForm` interface
- **Removed** `DatePicker` import from antd (no longer needed)
- The form UI never had a date of birth field rendered, so no visual changes needed

### 2. âœ… Types (`/src/types/index.ts`)
- **Removed** `date_of_birth?: string;` from `User` interface
- This ensures type consistency across the application

### 3. âœ… Verified No Other References
- âœ… API services don't include date_of_birth in registration interfaces
- âœ… AuthContext User interface doesn't include date_of_birth
- âœ… No other components reference date_of_birth

## Result

- **Registration form** no longer includes date of birth in the data sent to backend
- **Type safety** maintained - no TypeScript errors related to date_of_birth
- **Clean codebase** - no unused DatePicker import or interface properties

## What This Means

When users register now:
1. **Frontend** won't collect date of birth information
2. **Registration payload** won't include date_of_birth field
3. **Backend** will receive registration without date_of_birth (which should be fine since it was optional)

## Test Registration

You can now test the registration form:
1. Fill out the form (no date of birth field)
2. Submit registration
3. Check that it works properly without date_of_birth

The registration process should work exactly the same, just without collecting the date of birth information! ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

- The date_of_birth field was already optional (`?`) so removing it shouldn't break the backend
- No visual changes to the registration form since the field wasn't being rendered anyway
- All type definitions are now consistent without date_of_birth
