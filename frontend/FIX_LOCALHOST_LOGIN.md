# üîß Fix for Localhost Login Issue - SOLUTION

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ
Your `AuthContext.tsx` was using a hardcoded URL: `http://192.168.1.110/api/v1/auth/login/` instead of the environment variable.

## What I Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Updated AuthContext.tsx
- ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded URL: `http://192.168.1.110/api/v1/auth/login/`
- ‚úÖ Added environment variable usage: `process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`
- ‚úÖ Added fallback to your IP: `http://192.168.0.109:8000/api/v1`
- ‚úÖ Added debug logging to show which URL is being used

### 2. Current Configuration
Your `.env` file has:
```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.0.109:8000/api/v1
```

But AuthContext was using a different IP: `192.168.1.110`

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Restart Development Server
```bash
cd /home/hack-me-if-you-can/project_DIPLOM/frontend
pkill -f "react-scripts" || pkill -f "npm start"
npm start
```

### 2. Check Browser Console
When you open the app, you should see:
```
üîß AuthContext Debug:
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL from env: http://192.168.0.109:8000/api/v1
Final API_BASE_URL for auth: http://192.168.0.109:8000/api/v1
```

### 3. Try Login
When you attempt to login, you should see:
```
üîê Login URL being used: http://192.168.0.109:8000/api/v1/auth/login/
```

### 4. Check Network Tab
- Open Developer Tools ‚Üí Network tab
- Try to login
- You should see the request going to `192.168.0.109:8000` NOT `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`

## If You Want Different IP Address

If you need to use a different IP address, just update your `.env` file:

```env
# Change this line to your desired IP:
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://YOUR_DESIRED_IP:8000/api/v1
```

Then restart the development server.

## Verification Steps

### ‚úÖ 1. Environment Variable Loading
Check console for: `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL from env: http://192.168.0.109:8000/api/v1`

### ‚úÖ 2. Login URL 
Check console for: `Login URL being used: http://192.168.0.109:8000/api/v1/auth/login/`

### ‚úÖ 3. Network Requests
Check Network tab - requests should go to your IP, not localhost

### ‚úÖ 4. Backend Running
Make sure your Django backend is running on the same IP:
```bash
cd /home/hack-me-if-you-can/project_DIPLOM/e-center
python manage.py runserver 192.168.0.109:8000
```

## Root Cause
The issue was **hardcoded URL in AuthContext** that was different from your environment configuration. Now it uses the environment variable properly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
Make sure your backend Django server is running on the same IP address as configured in your `.env` file.

Backend should be running with:
```bash
python manage.py runserver 192.168.0.109:8000
```

NOT:
```bash
python manage.py runserver  # This runs on 127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Quick Test
1. Restart frontend dev server
2. Open browser console
3. Look for debug messages
4. Try to login
5. Check Network tab for actual request URL

The login should now use your configured IP address instead of localhost! üéâ
